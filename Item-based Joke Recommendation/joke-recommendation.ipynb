    "### 1. **Item-Based Joke Recommendation**\n",
    "#### For this problem you will use a modified version of the item-based recommender algorithm from Ch. 14 of Machine Learning in Action and use it on joke ratings data based on Jester Online Joke Recommender System. The modified version of the code is provided in the module itemBasedRec.py. Most of the module will be used as is, but you will add some additional functionality. The data set contains two files. The file \"**modified_jester_data.csv**\" contains the ratings on 100 jokes by 1000 users (each row is a user profile). The ratings have been normalized to be between 1 and 21 (a 20-point scale), with 1 being the lowest rating. A zero indicated a missing rating. The file \"**jokes.csv**\" contains the joke ids mapped to the actual text of the jokes. Your tasks in this problem are the following. "

    "#### a. **[10 pts]** Load in the joke ratings data and the joke text data into appropriate data structures. Use the \"**recommend**\" function to provide top 5 joke recommendations for **users with id 117** using both **Pearson and cosine similarity** measures. Note the differences. Use the standard item-based collaborative filtering (based on the rating prediction function \"**standEst**\"). Next, find the top 5 recommendations for **user with id 441** only with Pearson similarity using both the standard estimator and the SVD-based version (using \"**svdEst**\" as the prediction engine) to generate these recommendations. Note the differences. When outputting recommendations, you should show both the id and the text of the recommended jokes (in decreasing order of predicted rating) as well as the predicted ratings for each."

This happens because the standard estimator only relies on direct rating overlap between items, which is limited in a sparse rating matrix where most ratings are 0. On the other hand, the SVD-based estimator reduces the dimensionality of the user-item matrix and represents jokes in a latent feature space, which allows it to infer preferences even when the overlap in ratings is weak or missing (i.e., when many values are 0). As a result, the SVD-based recommendations differ._"

Develop your own item-based collaborative filtering recommender that uses a model-based approach (separating the training and the prediction tasks). In the training component, item-item similarities for all pairs of items are computed and stored in an appropriate data structure such as a pairwise similarity matrix. Your training function should be able to use different similarity functions (passed as a parameter) including cosine Similarity or Pearson correlation. The prediction (or estimation) function should take as parameters a target user, an item, a value of **k**, and the similarities matrix computed in the training phase. It should then return the predicted rating on the target item for the target user. The predicted rating should be the weighted average of the target user's ratings on the **k** most similar items to the target item (obtained from the similarity matrix). Demonstrate that your function works by computing predicted ratings for **users 117 and 441**, using **k = 10**, on top two items recommended to each user on part a (using both Pearson and cosine similarities)."
