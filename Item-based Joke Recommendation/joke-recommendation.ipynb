    "### 1. **Item-Based Joke Recommendation**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For this problem you will use a modified version of the item-based recommender algorithm from Ch. 14 of Machine Learning in Action and use it on joke ratings data based on Jester Online Joke Recommender System. The modified version of the code is provided in the module itemBasedRec.py. Most of the module will be used as is, but you will add some additional functionality. The data set contains two files. The file \"**modified_jester_data.csv**\" contains the ratings on 100 jokes by 1000 users (each row is a user profile). The ratings have been normalized to be between 1 and 21 (a 20-point scale), with 1 being the lowest rating. A zero indicated a missing rating. The file \"**jokes.csv**\" contains the joke ids mapped to the actual text of the jokes. Your tasks in this problem are the following.\n"

    "#### a. **[10 pts]** Load in the joke ratings data and the joke text data into appropriate data structures. Use the \"**recommend**\" function to provide top 5 joke recommendations for **users with id 117** using both **Pearson and cosine similarity** measures. Note the differences. Use the standard item-based collaborative filtering (based on the rating prediction function \"**standEst**\"). Next, find the top 5 recommendations for **user with id 441** only with Pearson similarity using both the standard estimator and the SVD-based version (using \"**svdEst**\" as the prediction engine) to generate these recommendations. Note the differences. When outputting recommendations, you should show both the id and the text of the recommended jokes (in decreasing order of predicted rating) as well as the predicted ratings for each."

This happens because the standard estimator only relies on direct rating overlap between items, which is limited in a sparse rating matrix where most ratings are 0. On the other hand, the SVD-based estimator reduces the dimensionality of the user-item matrix and represents jokes in a latent feature space, which allows it to infer preferences even when the overlap in ratings is weak or missing (i.e., when many values are 0). As a result, the SVD-based recommendations differ._\n"

Develop your own item-based collaborative filtering recommender that uses a model-based approach (separating the training and the prediction tasks). In the training component, item-item similarities for all pairs of items are computed and stored in an appropriate data structure such as a pairwise similarity matrix. Your training function should be able to use different similarity functions (passed as a parameter) including cosine Similarity or Pearson correlation. The prediction (or estimation) function should take as parameters a target user, an item, a value of **k**, and the similarities matrix computed in the training phase. It should then return the predicted rating on the target item for the target user. The predicted rating should be the weighted average of the target user's ratings on the **k** most similar items to the target item (obtained from the similarity matrix). Demonstrate that your function works by computing predicted ratings for **users 117 and 441**, using **k = 10**, on top two items recommended to each user on part a (using both Pearson and cosine similarities).\n"

    "_I developed item-based collaborative filtering recommender that uses a model-based approach (separating the training and the prediction tasks). The similarity_matrix function precomputes all pairwise item similarities and stores them in a matrix, making predictions much faster than the original implementation. The item_based_predict function uses the precomputed similarity matrix to find the k most similar items that the user has rated, then computes a weighted average of those ratings. This approach is more scalable since similarities are computed once during training rather than for each prediction. Testing on users 117 and 441 showed that the predictions vary between Pearson and cosine similarity measures, with Pearson generally producing more conservative estimates due to its bias adjustment._"

In thankfulness the woman said to the man 'We are both okay so we should celebrate. I have   a  bottle of wine in my car let's open it.' So the woman got the bottle out of the car and  handed it to the man. The man took a really big drink and handed the woman the bottle. The  woman  closed the bottle and put it down. The man  asked  'Aren't you going to take a drink?' The woman cleverly replied 'No I think I'll  just  wait for the cops to get here.' \n",

    "_I modified the cross_validate_user and test functions to work with the new item-based prediction function by creating cross_validate_user2 and test2 functions that accept a similarity matrix and k parameter. I tested the prediction accuracy using both Pearson and cosine similarity measures with k=10, which showed comparable performance to the original methods. Next, I computed MAE values across a range of k values from 1 to 40 to find the optimal k. The plot shows how prediction accuracy varies with k, where smaller k values may miss important similar items while larger k values may include less relevant items, affecting the weighted average. I identified the best k value that minimizes MAE from the plot. Finally, I modified the recommend function to create item_based_recommend that uses the item_based_predict function and generated top 3 recommendations for users 117 and 441 using the optimal k value. The results demonstrate that the model-based approach with precomputed similarities provides an efficient and scalable alternative to the original implementation._"

    "\n",
    "#### For this problem you will use an **image segmentation data set** for image classification. You will experiment with using PCA as an approach to reduce dimensionality and noise in the data. You will compare classification accuracies with and without PCA using the provided image class assignments as the class labels. You will also use machine Scikit-learn's pipelines to automate preprocessing, data transformation with PCA, and model optimization (using Random Forest). The data set is divided into three files. The file \"segmentation_data.txt\" contains data about images with each line corresponding to one image. Each image is represented by 19 features (these are the columns in the data and correspond to the feature names in the file \"segmentation_names.txt\". The file \"segmentation_classes.txt\" contains the class labels (the type of image) and a numeric class label for each of the corresponding images in the data file. The data set used in this problem is based on the Image Segmentation data set at the UCI Machine Learning Repository.\n",

You may use the linear algebra package in Numpy or the Decomposition module in scikit-learn (the latter is much more efficient). Analyze the principal components to determine the smallest number, r, of PCs needed to capture at least 95% of variance in the data. Provide a Scree plot of PC variances.

Also create a new StandardScaler object and a new PCA object (with the optimum number of components, r) without fitting these to the training data. Next, using either **make_pipeline()** or **Pipeline** from the **sklearn.pipeline** module, create two separate model pipelines, one with the sequence **StandardScaler --> RandomForestClassifier** and another with the sequence **StandardScaler --> PCA --> RandomForestClassifier**. Fit both model pipelines to the original, non-scaled, training data. For example, fitting the second model to the train data may result in this output."

Create a GridSearchCV object using this pipeline, the parameter grid, and 5-fold cross-validation. Then, run the grid search on the original non-scaled data. Report the best parameters and the overall cross-validation accuracy resulting from the grid search. Finally, create a new 3-step pipeline, as before, but with the RandomForest Classifier parameters set to the optimal values reported from the grid search. Fit this new model to the original training data, then compare the training accuracy with the accuracy on the set aside non-scaled test data from part (a)."
