    "### 1. **Item-Based Joke Recommendation**\n",
    "#### For this problem you will use a modified version of the item-based recommender algorithm from Ch. 14 of Machine Learning in Action and use it on joke ratings data based on Jester Online Joke Recommender System. The modified version of the code is provided in the module itemBasedRec.py. Most of the module will be used as is, but you will add some additional functionality. The data set contains two files. The file \"**modified_jester_data.csv**\" contains the ratings on 100 jokes by 1000 users (each row is a user profile). The ratings have been normalized to be between 1 and 21 (a 20-point scale), with 1 being the lowest rating. A zero indicated a missing rating. The file \"**jokes.csv**\" contains the joke ids mapped to the actual text of the jokes. Your tasks in this problem are the following. "

    "#### a. **[10 pts]** Load in the joke ratings data and the joke text data into appropriate data structures. Use the \"**recommend**\" function to provide top 5 joke recommendations for **users with id 117** using both **Pearson and cosine similarity** measures. Note the differences. Use the standard item-based collaborative filtering (based on the rating prediction function \"**standEst**\"). Next, find the top 5 recommendations for **user with id 441** only with Pearson similarity using both the standard estimator and the SVD-based version (using \"**svdEst**\" as the prediction engine) to generate these recommendations. Note the differences. When outputting recommendations, you should show both the id and the text of the recommended jokes (in decreasing order of predicted rating) as well as the predicted ratings for each."

Then used pandas to load the modified_jester_data as dataframe and converted to numpy array as recommend() function takes dataMat as numpy array. I also created a recommendation_output that uses jokes and the output from recommend() function to print joke id, score and joke text as required. for user with id 117, the recommend function with prediction fuction standEst with both cosine and pearson similarity gave similar top recommendations with jokeid 97, 99, 92, 75 appearing on both the lists. However pearson recommended 80 while cosine recommended 88. This is due to Pearson adjusts for each user's rating behaviour and bias, whereas cosine only measures the similarity between rating patterns without accounting for user's bias._\n",

    "_Again for the user with id 441, the recommend function using the standard estimator (standEst) and the SVD-based estimator (svdEst), both with Pearson similarity, returned different sets of jokes, and only the joke with id 5 appeared in both lists. This happens because the standard estimator only relies on direct rating overlap between items, which is limited in a sparse rating matrix where most ratings are 0. On the other hand, the SVD-based estimator reduces the dimensionality of the user-item matrix and represents jokes in a latent feature space, which allows it to infer preferences even when the overlap in ratings is weak or missing (i.e., when many values are 0). As a result, the SVD-based recommendations differ._"
